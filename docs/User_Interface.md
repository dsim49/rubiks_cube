### The user interface must include the following features:
- Click drag function to rotate the cube
- Zoom function to resize the cube
- Keyboard shortcuts for both resizing and rotating the cube
- Note: rotate has 2 meanings, so it is necessary to distinguish rotating the whole thing versus 
turning faces of the cube.

### Format of generated commands:
- Commands generated by user actions will map to specific numeric changes to the underlying logic layer 
values such as position, orientation, and cube state.
- They will call functions from within the logic layer to update the cube data structure accordingly.
- The commands will consist of the specific inputs and function calls that will cause the desired 
motion.
